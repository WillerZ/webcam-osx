<H2>What you can do</H2>
<H3>View Video from your Webcam</H3>
<P>Plug in your USB webcam. If it's supported, you should see a &quot;Connected&quot; message in the status field. Now click on the blue play triangle in the window toolbar or select &quot;Play&quot; from the control menu. Voil&agrave;! To enhance the image quality, select &quot;Camera settings&quot; form the Control menu and adjust the sliders until you find a pleasant setting. Which sliders are enabled depends on your camera. Select &quot;Burn current Setting&quot; to make the current setting the default for future sessions. Settings for different camera types will be saved separately.</P>
<H3>Save Images from Screen</H3>
<P>Click on the Camera with the flashlight in the toolbar or select &quot;Take Image&quot; from the Control menu. A window with the image will appear. You can save it the ordinary way.</P>
<H3>Download Images from your Webcam</H3>
<P>If you have a camera that can take images without being plugged into the computer, you will be asked if you want to download them as soon as you plug it in. If you decide not to do so, you can still save them by choosing &quot;Download Images...&quot; form the Control menu. Note that they will be downloaded in the current camera settings.</P>
<H3>Use multiple webcams</H3>
<P>If you have more than one webcam, you can choose another webcam by selecting &quot;Next Camera&quot; from the Controls menu.</P>
<H3>More elaborate things</H3>
<P>To record movies, use multiple cameras simultaneously, do video conferences, put your webcam online and do other funny things, you can use other applications that support QuickTime video input, for example BTV, BTV Pro, Oculus, CoolCam, iSpQ VideoChat and many more. In order to use them, you have to put the file &quot;macam.component&quot; to the &quot;QuickTime&quot; folder which resides in the &quot;Library&quot; folder on your system hard disk. When you start the thrird party application, each connected webcam will be available as an additional video input. See the application's documentation for details.</P>
