
the last thing I heard was a mail from April 24th stating that they are 
working on it and it should be fixed within the next days. Do you know 
people there who could speed that up? The delay is surprising to me 
because it's just a matter of copying a single file...

I've attached a version with an inspector. Currently, it's a quick hack, 
but you will probably get the idea: The camera driver class (model 
layer) may specify the name of an inspector controller class (via the 
"CameraFeature" thing). 

The inspector has to be subclass of 
"MyCameraInspector" (the base class does the generic inspector). 
MyController (controller of the main window) can instantiate the class, 
and assign the inspector's view to a window. Creation and disposal of 
the window is handled by MyController, the interaction in the view is 
controlled by your InspectorConroller (I would have preferred of having 
them completely separated, but then, the InspectorController would have 
to provide a NSWindow. Providing an NSView is probably more versatile 
because it can be incorporated into panes, subviews and whatever). 

The 
default Inspector controller loads a nib file (with itself as the owner) 
and displays the camera name. I thought you might be interested in this 
preliminary implementation so we can change things if you think that 
this is no good idea.
