Fix all (c) and license info
Get matthias to pick a (c) and a name
Ascii text file with supported drivers
Write scripts to generate .dmg files and
    automate versionnumbering based on 
    cvs tags
Fixup all .cvsignore files and/or collect them
    in a CVSROOT/cvsignore file for things such
    as .DS_Store
Domain - would it make sense to make this a 
    org.sourceforge.webcam-os in the application
    settings field - or does the lattter not
    do anything but has to be unique; in which
    case de.matthias-krauss.macam is fine and
    a nice historic reminder.
