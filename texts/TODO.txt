Fix all (c) and license info
Get matthias to pick a (c) and a name
Make sure that things like the license
	are copied into the binary app build.
Ascii text file with supported drivers
Write scripts to generate .dmg files and
    automate versionnumbering based on 
    cvs tags
Fixup all .cvsignore files and/or collect them
    in a CVSROOT/cvsignore file for things such
    as .DS_Store
Domain - would it make sense to make this a 
    org.sourceforge.webcam-os in the application
    settings field - or does the lattter not
    do anything but has to be unique; in which
    case de.matthias-krauss.macam is fine and
    a nice historic reminder.

Added a whole slew of SPCA50x based camears in
MyIntelPCCameraPro. These are not ready for
public consuption. Perhaps we need an iface in
which we can limit to just known/production cameras
and an extra one where you can run time try out
a driver with a camera by fidling the numbers.
-> the MyIntelPCCameraPro.h/m files need to be
   split up and/or we need a slightly more
   clever recognition system to cope with
   lists rather than single id pairs.
